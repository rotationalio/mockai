The opening lines to Henry David Thoreau's Walden are:
'When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.'

1. For each customer (recname), calculate the count of unique `calendar_week` values (denominator). 2. For each customer (recname), calculate the count of unique `calendar_week` values where `is_take_a_ride` is True (numerator). 3. For each customer (recname), calculate the ride frequency rate as numerator √∑ denominator. 4. Calculate the total `qtytakearide` for each customer (recname). 5. Calculate the total `qtydelivered` for each customer (recname). 6. Calculate the sum of `totalcharged` for each customer (recname). 7. Filter for customers where the ride frequency rate is at least 0.5. 8. Display the customer names (recname), their calculated ride frequency, total `qtytakearide`, total `qtydelivered`, and total `totalcharged`, sorted by total `qtytakearide`.
